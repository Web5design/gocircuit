			<h1>Designing circuit apps</h1>

			<p class="first">Let us use, as a running example, an actual “sleeve” from Tumblr's impressions analytics circuit.</p>

			<h3>New administration paradigm</h3>
			<p>Administration is the traditionally loosely-defined process of monitoring the health of network services and 
			taking action when critical events &mdash; failure or “approaching capacity”, for instance &mdash; occur.
			Consider our example, where app <em>A</em> uses app <em>B</em> which, in turn, uses app <em>C</em>.
			And recall that each app is embodied in a cluster of hosts, running a myriad of app processes.</p>

			<p>Assume e.g. that <code>client</code> is a “smart” client for a network service and suppose <code>client</code>
			has a single method, called <code>FetchPost</code> that contacts the service and fetches some useful return value:</p>
<pre>
type Client interface {
	FetchPost(id int64) []byte
}
</pre>
