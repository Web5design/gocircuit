			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<div class="moto">In implementing a distributed application, one should
				be able to express the intra-host as well as inter-host program logic
				within a common, “uniform” linguistic
				environment &mdash; much like a Go program is a common and sufficient
				language for expressing the intra-goroutine and
				inter-goroutine logic of a complete application.

			<p class="first">The <em>Go Circuit</em>
			attempts to extend the reach of the <a href="">Go Language</a> to
			distributed computation. The goal of this project is to build a
			programming environment that facilitates both the development and
			the life-long maintenance of cloud applications and even interdependent
			multi-application systems.</p>

			<p>This “umbrella” goal aims at finding a clean solution to a set of
			specific types of systematic inefficiencies that we have witnessed
			in the life-cycle of the development and maintenance of the
			<em>Tumblr Platform</em>. Some of the ?? are:
			<ul>
				<li>Decouple application logic from:
					<ul>
					<li>Low-level networking logic (transport, security, )</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
