update circuit's firehose driver
	move to kit/tumblr/firehose
	test firehose driver for correct reconnects

errors.errorString not registered
	automatically convert unregistered errors into a circuit error

pass slice and map

Ref -> Tele XVal (ExportValue)?

4jailtail
	anchor file system graveyard
	find dead workers in graveyard
	use new worker to pass file
____________________________________________________
CAVEAT:
When passing a slice in an x-call, changes to the underlying array at the callee 
will not be reflected at the called.
Similarly for maps.

topic-specific subscriptions
4lsof (list registered listeners, etc. resources) and also dup the lsof of the unix process
zombie detect/kill mechanism (procs not in anchor fs)
	add hidden flat registration space for runtime IDS in anchor file system
	add permanent flat registration space, where workers check in and out

POST OPEN-SOURCE

4crossbuild takeover upload to hosts?
add method for gob registration of types in circuit (use custom circuit type names?)

reconnect mechanism
	design of network partition resilience:
		â€”> when disconnect is noticed, worker reports to a central admin
		database that they are experiencing a network partition
		-> worker does not give up redials until admin explicitly declares
		connection dead

mechanism whereby if a runtime dies PREMATURELY, all child/descendant runtimes
(i.e. runtimes spawned at the root by that runtime) are killed. Mimics
goroutine mutual semantics.

circuit-friendly stack traces
lockfiles in durable file system to ensure no race-conditions on state changes
add issue locking in issue file system for concurrency safety

garbage collect empty dirs in durable
	tool to list all files and clear them, etc.
