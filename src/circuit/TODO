CONFIG FRICTION:
	circuit configs are user specific since they contain hardcoded absolute paths
------------------------------------------
4jailtail
	bug: when 4jailtail quit the remote tail process does not disappear (they get write error, in one case)
		garbage collection kicks in?
	bug: when the remote tail process is killed, 4jailtail hangs waiting
	can tail also be made child process so it dies when worker dies

add test app for garbage collection

anchor graveyard
	anchor file system graveyard
	find dead workers in graveyard
	use new worker to pass file

____________________________________________________
Ref -> Tele XVal (ExportValue)?
4lsof (list registered listeners, etc. resources) and also dup the lsof of the unix process
zombie detect/kill mechanism (procs not in anchor fs)
	add hidden flat registration space for runtime IDS in anchor file system
	add permanent flat registration space, where workers check in and out

4build: optionally use existing go installation
4crossbuild: takeover upload to hosts?
add method for gob registration of types in circuit (use custom circuit type names?)

reconnect mechanism
	design of network partition resilience:
		â€”> when disconnect is noticed, worker reports to a central admin
		database that they are experiencing a network partition
		-> worker does not give up redials until admin explicitly declares
		connection dead

mechanism whereby if a runtime dies PREMATURELY, all child/descendant runtimes
(i.e. runtimes spawned at the root by that runtime) are killed. Mimics
goroutine mutual semantics.

circuit-friendly stack traces
lockfiles in durable file system to ensure no race-conditions on state changes
add issue locking in issue file system for concurrency safety

garbage collect empty dirs in durable
	tool to list all files and clear them, etc.

advanced rate-limiter
topic-specific subscriptions
