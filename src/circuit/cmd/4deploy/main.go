4deploy installs locally-available circuit binaries to a cluster of hosts
supplied to standard input, one host per line.

Invokation:
	
	% CIR=app.config 4deploy < host_list

4deploy expects an app configuration file name in the CIR environment variable.
The deploy tool looks at the Deploy and Build sections of the config (so other
sections need not be present).  From the Deploy section it determines where on
the remote hosts to install the circuit application.  From the Build section it
determines where to find the shipping directory on the local host, which holds
the result of a preceding cross-build.

The tool also reads a list of host names from standard input, one per line, and
installs the app binaries to each given host in parallel.
