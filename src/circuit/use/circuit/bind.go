// RegisterValue registers the type of v with the circuit runtime type system.

// function within of the package that defines the type of v.

// RegisterFunc registers the worker function type fn with the circuit runtime type system.
// fn must be of a not-necessarily public type having a single public method.
// As a result, this program is able to spawn fn on remote hosts, as well as to host
// remote invokations of fn.
// By convention, RegisterFunc should be invoked from a dedicated init
// function within of the package that defines the type of fn.

// The worker function fn, whose type must have previously been registered with RegisterFunc,

// Spawn blocks until the execution of fn completes.
// Spawn returns the return values of fn's invokation in the slice retrn.
// The types of the elements of retrn exactly match the declared return types of fn's singleton public method.
// Spawn also returns the address of the spawned worker in addr.
// The new worker will be killed as soon as fn completes, unless an extension of its life is
// explicitly requested during the execution of fn via a call to Daemonize.
