			<h1>Rapid dive into the circuit</h1>

			<p class="first">In the first part of this article, we demonstrate the linguistic
				convenience that the circuit brings to distributed programming by
			building a real-time MapReduce cloud application that keeps track of the top ten
			most popular blogs on Tumblr in the past one minute. This <em>trending blog</em>
			application is <em>entirely implemented in a single source file</em> of a few hundred lines.
			In the second half, we showcase the command-line tools
			for querying, debugging, profiling and controlling deployed circuits. 
			We don't focus here on the procedure for building (compiling and linking) 
			circuit apps.</p>

			<p>The heart of what the circuit offers to the programmer is a linguistic facility
				for spawning goroutines on remote hosts.To support that facility well, the circuit
				also provides ways for passing arguments and returning values across the network in
				a type safe manner. The latter is barely noticeable to the programmer, as it is 
				achieved nearly transparently from a programming point of view. We discuss both of 
				these first. This puts us in shape
				to then proceed with implementing a real-world cloud application.</p>

			<h3>The spawn operation</h3>
			<p class="first">The circuit's main goal is to facilitate development of 
				multi-process applications. To that end, we made two high-level design choices:
				<ul>
					<li><em>Application logic should have access to the operation of spawning additional
						(not necessarily identical) process.</em> This is in contrast to traditional
						workflows in cloud architectures. There, an administrator — entity different than the
						application programmer — executes a group of processes belonging to the same logical app
						and notifies these processes of each other's existence by way of configurations, typically
						provided at startup.</li>
				</ul>

			... To get our feet wet, consider an elementary circuit app:</p>
<pre>
package main

// 1. Load the circuit runtime
import "tumblr/circuit"

// 2. Implement the function that we would like to spawn remotely:
func (RemoteMain) RemoteMain() {
	println("Hòla a todo el mundo!")
}

// 3*. Wrap it as the single method of a dummy class
type RemoteMain struct{}

// 4*. And make the circuit runtime aware that RemoteMain is remotely spawn-able
func init() {
	circuit.RegisterFunc(RemoteMain{})
}

// 5. Implement the code that runs locally at the execution site (usually an admin console)
func main() {
	if _, _, err := circuit.Spawn("remote.org", nil, RemoteMain{}); err != nil {
		println("A physical problem occurred.")
		return
	}
	println("Greeting accomplished!")
}
</pre>

			<p>This is an elementary example that far-underscores the power of <code>Spawn</code>, but
				it provides a starting point for thinking about the circuit runtime environment. What happens
				when we run this program?

				The invocation of <code>Spawn</code> causes a new circuit runtime process to be started on
				the host <code>remote.org</code>. This process is immediately instructed to execute the
				function <code>RemoteMain</code>. When execution completes, the invoking runtime is notified
				and the call to <code>Spawn</code> returns.</p> 

				<p>In this particular example, the remote runtime
				is killed immediately after it notifies the invoking runtime that the call has completed.
				Later, we will see other patterns that allow us to start a long-running logic
				remotely and return into the caller immediately while retaining means to communicate with the
				remote thread of execution.</p>

			<div class="footnote">
				<p class="first">(On a side note, observe that steps <code>3*</code> and <code>4*</code> are cruft. A circuit app would normally 
					accrue about 6 lines of curft for each different <em>type</em> of worker process in the application's network topology. It is a small price to pay, we believe, for the programming
				convenience attained otherwise. </p>

			<h3>Real time map/reduce example</h3>

			<p class="first">In order to put some flesh around our circuit tutorial, we are going to build a real-world, real-time
			map/reduce application. The app &mdash; trending blogs &mdash; will continuously consume user events
			from the Tumblr Firehose, and will maintain an in-memory ranking of the top ten blogs, as decided by
			their “like” count throughout the immediately preceding minute. Look at the following figure:</p>
			<img src="img/arm.png" />
			<p>This is the network service topology we would like to build. 
				Each box represents a separate process running on a separate host. The M-boxes are mappers. They
				continually consume events from the Tumblr Firehose service, which outputs a stream of JSON events
				over a traditional HTTP protocol. For each “like” event, the receiving mapper identifies
				a reducer, an R-box, that is responsible for the affected blog ID &mdash; the space of
				blog IDs is partitioned across the reducers. It then calls into that reducer to announce the new “like”
				event. The reducer, which keeps track of blogs' like counts from the past minute, updates the
				respective structure and returns.</p>

			<p>Each reducer maintains the blogs at hand in sorted-by-like-count order, thereby always ready to
				produce the ten most liked blogs upon request. This will be accomplished using a binary search tree (BST).
				An altogether separate aggregator process, the A-box, periodically calls into every reducer and collects
				the top ten blogs from each. It then computes the global top ten and remembers it, making it available to
				upstream apps on demand.</p>

			<p>You will notice the arrows in the above diagram point in different directions. An arrow pointing
				from box X to box Y indicates that X is calling into Y in our application. In particular, on the left hand-side the mappers
				are calling into the reducers. Naturally, it is their job, as they are the ones who first encounter
				the new events. On the right hand side, we have made a design choice that the aggregator calls into
				the reducers to periodically update its global top ten list. The connection between the mappers and the
				Firehose service are external to the circuit and hence have no arrows.</p>

			<p>(It is possible to implement a similar app using other combinations of
				call orientations. In general, different designs correspond to different event reaction semantics and
				network data flow.)</p>

			<p>It may be helpful to relate this call-based mechanism for transporting information to others.
				For example, calling into a remote worker for the purpose of obtaining some information (in the return values)
				is also known as a <em>pull</em> model. Whereas, calling into a worker in order to give new information
				(in the function arguments) is also known as a <em>push</em> model.</p>

				<p>The objective is now fully laid out. In the
				coming sections, we will implement the trending
				blog application, while taking short
				intermissions to introduce facilities provided
				by the circuit runtime, starting with the
				<em>anchor file system</em>.</p>

			<h3>Anchor file system</h3>

			<p>We have 

			<p>In general, the group of circuit runtime processes, called <em>workers</em> for short, executing</p>


			<p>It turns out that it easier to go backwards: First, we'll implement the aggregator, then the reducer
			and finally the mapper. For this reason, and because the Aggregator-Reducer-Mapper is a common design
			gadget, we'll call it an <abbr>ARM</abbr>.</p>

			<h3>Implementing the aggregator</h3>
			<p>The job of the aggregator is to sweep through all mappers and ask each of them what are the top
				ten blogs among the blogs residing with them. The aggreagor would then combine these answers into
				a single top ten list, made available to others upon demand.</p>
<pre>
import ("sync"; "sort")

// Blog pairs a blog name with its respective rank
type Blog struct{
	Name string
	Rank float64
}

// SortBlogs is in-place sortable by blog rank by implementing sort.Interface
// We omit the implementation for brevity
type SortBlogs []*Blog

// Aggregator encloses the state of the aggregation worker
type Aggregator struct{
	lk     sync.Mutex
	topTen SortBlogs
}

// TopTen returns the top ten blogs in order and will be callable remotely
func (a *Aggregator) TopTen() []*Blog {
	a.lk.Lock()
	defer a.lk.Unlock()
	r := make([]*Blog, len(a.topTen))
	copy(r, a.topTen)
	return r
}

func NewAggregator() {
	??
}

</pre>

			<h4>Reducer</h4>
			<h4>Mapper</h4>
			<p>Let's implement the mapper worker now. The job of each mapper is to connect to the 
			Tumblr Firehose and greedily read events from it. For each event that is a “like”,
			the mapper forwards the event to the reducer worker, responsible for the blog affected by
		       the event.</p>
<pre>
import "tumblr/firehose"

type Mapper struct {
	firehose *firehose.Conn
