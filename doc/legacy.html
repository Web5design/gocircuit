			<h1>Circuitizing legacy applications</h1>

			<div class="moto">
				A pre-existing, or “legacy”, Go application can be easily run and managed by the circuit with no modification of its internal logic at all.
			</div>

			<h3 id="intro">Integration in a line</h3>

			<p>For any pre-existing application, simply add 
				<pre>import _ "circuit/load"</pre>
				to the main program package and go on to compile it as usual with <code>go build</code>.

			<p>Executing the compiled binary is no different than before the circuit was imported into it, except for the added requirement that the <code>CIR</code> environment points to an <a href="config.html">app configuration file</a> that specifies a <code>Zookeeper</code> section. (The <code>Build</code> and <code>Deploy</code> sections are not needed.)

			<p>You can find a sample application in subdirectory <code>tutorials/legacy</code>. When executed, the program will sleep for a short while, giving you an opportunity to switch terminals and verify its presence using the <code>4ls</code> tool.
