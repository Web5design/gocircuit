The Go Circuit Project
======================

The Go Circuit is an extension to the Go Language and Runtime, which enables
development of distributed applications entirely inside the Go programming
environment in a manner similar to Erlang: by the addition of a `Spawn`
operator for spawning arbitrary goroutines on remote hosts.

The Go Circuit programming and deployment interface could be likened to that of
Google AppEngine, conceptually. In particular, the circuit is much like "your
own AppEngine". Unlike with AppEngine, programming for the circuit is
considerably more integrated with the Go Language and access to low-level
machine facilities is exposed to the user.

See the [Go Circuit project page](http://gocircuit.org) for more details.
